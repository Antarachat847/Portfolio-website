            I had the privilege of collaborating with Cadbury on their Diwali packaging for their e-commerce platform, <br> a creatively fulfilling and inspiring experience. The project celebrated togetherness, <br> a cornerstone of Diwali, through a unique card game designed to foster family connections <br> as well as custom box packaging which included a picture frame, goodie bag filled with choclates as well as a <br>personalised message making this the perfect gift to celebrate this festival of lights and unity. <br><br>
